# titanic_survival

## Overview

This python project aims to predict survival outcomes from the 1912 Titanic disaster based on each passengerâ€™s features (pclass, name, sex, age, sibsp, parch, ticket, fare, cabin, embarked).

The main code [`titanic_survival.ipynb`](https://github.com/adsasmita/titanic_survival/blob/master/titanic_survival.ipynb) is presented in a [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook) / iPython notebook for readability purposes.

Visualization codes are contained in [`visuals.py`](https://github.com/adsasmita/titanic_survival_exploration/blob/master/visuals.py)

## Data

The dataset used in this project is included as `titanic_data.csv`. This dataset is provided by Udacity and contains the following attributes:

- `pclass` : Passenger Class (1 = 1st; 2 = 2nd; 3 = 3rd)
- `name` : Name
- `sex` : Sex
- `age` : Age
- `sibsp` : Number of Siblings/Spouses Aboard
- `parch` : Number of Parents/Children Aboard
- `ticket` : Ticket Number
- `fare` : Passenger Fare
- `cabin` : Cabin
- `embarked` : Port of Embarkation (C = Cherbourg; Q = Queenstown; S = Southampton)

**Target Variable**
- `survival` : Survival (0 = No; 1 = Yes)
